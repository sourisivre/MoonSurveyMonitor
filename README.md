### EVE Online software for moon survey reports with online apraisal

Here you will be able to use a java software with GUI developed with [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) to copy and paste the moon survey report from EVE Online and perform an apraisal through [Evepraisal API](https://evepraisal.com/api-docs).

The software is able to generate a internal report in `.txt` format that you can store in your system or share with friends.

Further I will bring here a manual with instructions of how to use it.
